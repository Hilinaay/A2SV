  Navigating Career Opportunities Welcome to ET Jobs, a revolutionary job entry website developed as part 
          of my CS50 project. This platform encapsulates the principles learned in the course, channeling them into
           a user-friendly interface that simplifies the job hunting process. ET Jobs offers a range of pages, from
            the Home Page to the Contact Page, providing a comprehensive user experience that mirrors the dynamic
             problem-solving approach emphasized in CS50.

   Why this topic for the  project
         The project is a webpage where people can find jobs especially fresh graduate. In order to keepÂ the 
         project scope in check, the implementation is very straightforward. The idea for this project emerged due
          to many young fresh graduates being lost on where to look for jobs after graduation.We hope that after 
          some modification this website can resolve their problem.
